abstract = {Cancer stem cell (CSC) biology and tumor immunology have shaped our understanding of tumorigenesis. However, we still do not fully understand why tumors can be contained but not eliminated by the immune system and whether rare CSCs are required for tumor propagation. Long latency or recurrence periods have been described for most tumors. Conceptually, this requires a subset of malignant cells which is capable of initiating tumors, but is neither eliminated by immune cells nor able to grow straight into overt tumors. These criteria would be fulfilled by CSCs. Stem cells are pluripotent, immune-privileged, and long-living, but depend on specialized niches. Thus, latent tumors may be maintained by a niche-constrained reservoir of long-living CSCs that are exempt from immunosurveillance while niche-independent and more immunogenic daughter cells are constantly eliminated. The small subpopulation of CSCs is often held responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis, and recurrence. Experimentally, this hypothesis was supported by the observation that only this subset can propagate tumors in non-obese diabetic/scid mice, which lack T and B cells. Yet, the concept was challenged when an unexpectedly large proportion of melanoma cells were found to be capable of seeding complex tumors in mice which further lack NK cells. Moreover, the link between stem cell-like properties and tumorigenicity was not sustained in these highly immunodeficient animals. In humans, however, tumor-propagating cells must also escape from immune-mediated destruction. The ability to persist and to initiate neoplastic growth in the presence of immunosurveillance - which would be lost in a maximally immunodeficient animal model - could hence be a decisive criterion for CSCs. Consequently, integrating scientific insight from stem cell biology and tumor immunology to build a new concept of "CSC immunology" may help to reconcile the outlined contradictions and to improve our understanding of tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {RNA abundance is a powerful indicator of the state of individual cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal RNA abundance with high quantitative accuracy, sensitivity and throughput1. However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity-the time derivative of the gene expression state-can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

@article{Ganguly2006,
abstract = {Recent research on the origin of brain cancer has implicated a subpopulation of self-renewing brain cancer stem cells for malignant tumour growth. Various genes that regulate self-renewal in normal stem cells are also found in cancer stem cells. This implies that cancers can occur because of mutations in normal stem cells and early progenitor cells. A predictive mathematical model based on the cell compartment method is presented here to pose and validate non-intuitive scenarios proposed through the neural cancer stem cell hypothesis. The growths of abnormal (stem and early progenitor) cells from their normal counterparts are ascribed with separate mutation probabilities. Stem cell mutations are found to be more significant for the development of cancer than a similar mutation in the early progenitor cells. The model also predicts that, as previously hypothesized, repeated insult to mature cells increases the formation of abnormal progeny, and hence the risk of cancer.},

annote = {* State of field for ovarian cancer * Current treatments and outcomes * Ovca presents very late. The internal location of the cancer and general lack of screening options lead to most cases being diagnosed at a later stage than many other cancers would. * Treatment options have largely focused on sugical debulking and platinum based chemotherapy. * Risk factors are inherited: germline mutations in breast cancer susceptible genes (e.g. brca), nulliparity, infertility, enometriosis, obesity, age, potentially perineal talc. * Reducing factors that have been found to be potentially significant are gravidity, oral contraceptive use, regular use of aspirin, and nsaids. * Currently, population screening in ovca has not been found to be effective. * Epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 95{\%} of ovarian malignancies * 5 eoc subtypes: high-grade serous, low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous * HGSOC has the highest incidence with 70{\%} of eoc cases. * It is believed fallopian tube epithelium is the possible site for tumor initiation. * Mutations in p53 are seen in +90{\%} cases of HGSOC * p53 mutations and brca inactivation lead to high numbers of copy variation. * HGSOC has 4 prognostic subtypes: differntiated, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and proliferative * Immunoreactive is considered to have the best overall survivial while mesenchymal has the worst. * Ovca cells also overexpress folate and mesothelin which have been targest for antibody therapy. * LGSOC is seen in about 10{\%} of cases * LGSOC is considered to develop in a pathway which is very distinct from HGSOC * B-Raf and KRAS mutations are the most commonly present in LGSOC * Hormone therapy is sometimes used due to the presence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. * CNAs in p53 are rare, and brca inactivation seem to unrelated to LGSOC * OCCC or clear cell carcinoma represents about 5{\%} of cases. * The pathogenesis of OCCC is not well understood. * A proposed mechanism is related to the level of iron content, promoting oxidative stress. * Mutations in the SWI/SNF and PI3K pathway are represented in large proportions of cases. * Activation of the PI3K or RTK pathway has resulted in better OS * OCCCs are found to have considerably fewer CNAs and mutations in p53 or brca genes. * Endometrioid cancers represent 10{\%} of EOC cases. * Current thought is that endometrioid and OCCC arise from similar pathways. * Deregulation of WNT/b-catenin and PI3K pathways are essential in mouse models. * Mucinous OC is a rare subtype. * Could be classified as non-invasive and infiltrative. * KRAS mutations are a common feature of this subtype. * p53 and brca mutations do not seem to play a role. * Treatment * To date, there has been no randomized assessment of debulking surgery, platinum therapy, or radiation therapy. * Surgery has been the bedrock of therapy. * Surgery involves many approaches including primary, interval, and secondary debulking * Chemotherapy * carboplatin is as effective as cisplatin and is better tolerated. * dose is important. * pairing drugs does not improve outcomes. * IP chemo is often used due to the tight localization of ovca in the abdomen * hyperthermic IP chemo is currently being explored with reasonable results * Treatment after recurrence follows several judgements of benefit. * Recurrence after a period of over 6mo suggests platnum sensitivity where platinum based chemo would be reapplied * Shorter intervals of recurrence employ non-platinum based therarpies * Current consensus is the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel together every 3wks * Targeted therarpy has beeng gradually introduced in recent years. * Bevacizumab has shown the greatest promise among antiangiogenics being the only one in clinical use. * PARP inhibitors * Used as maintenance with platinum therapy at the time of recurrence. * A trial showed that the key benefit in PFS was driven by the parp inhibitor maintenance therapy. * Trial from 2018 led to first-line maintenance in brca mutated cases * Stratified approach to systemtic therapy can be used with bevacizumab after surgery with a switch to maintenance on the basis of brca mutations. * Immunetherapy is currently being explored on several fronts though none are in clinical practice. * ovca has a high expression of PD-L1. * Checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1/PD1 or CTLA-4 have shown only modest results. * Autologous cell therapy is also being utilized. * A variation of this therpay is exploring car-t cells targeting mesothelin * Vaccines have not worked well due to the highly immunosuppressive cancer environment * A vaccine targeting survivin is currently being explored * Additionally, the concept of the patient-specific mutanome is being researched in an effort to develope patient-specific cancer vaccines. * OCCC and LGSOC are relatively chemoresistant. * Prevention and screening are currently limited. * There is no validated screening method for standard practice. * Ultrasound has produced false-negatives and false-positives and is not recommended. * Screening high-risk populations has been shown to be effective but requires prior knowledge of family history. * Some biomarkers have been utilized such as HE4 in combination with CA125. * Another approach has been to evaluate DNA methylation in cfDNA.},

@article{Kondrashova2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association for Cancer Research. High-grade epithelial ovarian carcinomas containing mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) homologous recombination (HR) genes are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi), while restoration of HR function due to secondary mutations in BRCA1/2 has been recognized as an important resistance mechanism. We sequenced core HR pathway genes in 12 pairs of pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsy samples collected from patients in ARIEL2 Part 1, a phase II study of the PARPi rucaparib as treatment for platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian carcinoma. In 6 of 12 pretreatment biopsies, a truncation mutation in BRCA1, RAD51C, or RAD51D was identified. In five of six paired postprogression biopsies, one or more secondary mutations restored the open reading frame. Four distinct secondary mutations and spatial heterogeneity were observed for RAD51C. In vitro complementation assays and a patient-derived xenograft, as well as predictive molecular modeling, confirmed that resistance to rucaparib was associated with secondary mutations. Significance: Analyses of primary and secondary mutations in RAD51C and RAD51D provide evidence for these primary mutations in conferring PARPi sensitivity and secondary mutations as a mechanism of acquired PARPi resistance. PARPi resistance due to secondary mutations underpins the need for early delivery of PARPi therapy and for combination strategies.},

abstract = {Cancer is a disease driven by genetic variation and mutation. Exome sequencing can be utilized for discovering these variants and mutations across hundreds of tumors. Here we present an analysis tool, VarScan 2, for the detection of somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in exome data from tumor-normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy number changes. We apply these methods to the analysis of exome sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790 somatic coding mutations, achieving 93{\%} sensitivity and 85{\%} precision for single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection. Exome-based CNA analysis identified 29 large-scale alterations and 619 focal events per tumor on average. As in our previous analysis of these data, we observed frequent amplification of oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1, MYC) and deletion of tumor suppressors (NF1, PTEN, and CDKN2A). We searched for additional recurrent focal CNAs using the correlation matrix diagonal segmentation (CMDS) algorithm, which identified 424 significant events affecting 582 genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate the robust performance of VarScan 2 for somatic mutation and CNA detection and shed new light on the landscape of genetic alterations in ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. T cells directed against mutant neo-epitopes drive cancer immunity. However, spontaneous immune recognition of mutations is inefficient. We recently introduced the concept of individualized mutanome vaccines and implemented an RNA-based poly-neo-epitope approach to mobilize immunity against a spectrum of cancer mutations. Here we report the first-in-human application of this concept in melanoma. We set up a process comprising comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. All patients developed T cell responses against multiple vaccine neo-epitopes at up to high single-digit percentages. Vaccine-induced T cell infiltration and neo-epitope-specific killing of autologous tumour cells were shown in post-vaccination resected metastases from two patients. The cumulative rate of metastatic events was highly significantly reduced after the start of vaccination, resulting in a sustained progression-free survival. Two of the five patients with metastatic disease experienced vaccine-related objective responses. One of these patients had a late relapse owing to outgrowth of $\beta$2-microglobulin-deficient melanoma cells as an acquired resistance mechanism. A third patient developed a complete response to vaccination in combination with PD-1 blockade therapy. Our study demonstrates that individual mutations can be exploited, thereby opening a path to personalized immunotherapy for patients with cancer.},

abstract = {Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny1. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.},

Here, to decode this complexity, we derived copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of 117 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases, which were validated on 527 independent cases. We show that HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in known patterns of genomic aberration.

Measurement of signature exposures provides a rational framework to choose combination treatments that target multiple mutational processes.},

abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a minor subpopulation of tumour cells that share some features with the normal stem cells of the tissue from which tumour derives and have the properties of self-renewal, multiple differentiation and tumour initiation (tumour-initiating cells, TICs). Thus CSCs/TICs need to survive cancer therapies in order to provide new, more differentiated, metastatic-prone tumour cells. This occurs through different signals delivered within the tumour microenvironment. The immune system of cancer patients may recognise CSCs/TICs and kill them though it is unclear whether this may occur in vivo during spontaneous tumour growth. This review summarises findings on the immunological profile of CSCs/TICs as compared with neoplastic non-stem cells and discusses the possible antigens recognised by the patients' immune system, the in vitro and the potential in vivo immunogenicity of such antigens and the ability of human CSCs/TICs to down-regulate the immune response by the release of a variety of suppressive factors. We conclude that available data on immunological characterisation of CSCs/TICs may be useful in the perspective of designing new translational immunotherapy protocols targeting CSCs/TICs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.},

abstract = {Treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD) complicates therapies for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Based on evidence that PCa cells can transdifferentiate to other neuroectodermally-derived cell lineages in vitro, we proposed that NEtD requires first an intermediary reprogramming to metastable cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) of a neural class and we demonstrate that several different AR+/PSA+ PCa cell lines were efficiently reprogrammed to, maintained and propagated as CSCs by growth in androgen-free neural/neural crest (N/NC) stem medium. Such reprogrammed cells lost features of prostate differentiation; gained features of N/NC stem cells and tumor-initiating potential; were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition; and acquired an invasive phenotype in vitro and in vivo. When placed back into serum-containing mediums, reprogrammed cells could be redifferentiated to N-/NC-derived cell lineages or return back to an AR+ prostate-like state. Once returned, the AR+ cells were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition. Acute androgen deprivation or anti-androgen treatment in serum-containing medium led to the transient appearance of a sub-population of cells with similar characteristics. Finally, a 132 gene signature derived from reprogrammed PCa cell lines distinguished tumors from PCa patients with adverse outcomes. This model may explain neural manifestations of PCa associated with lethal disease. The metastable nature of the reprogrammed stem-like PCa cells suggests that cycles of PCa cell reprogramming followed by re-differentiation may support disease progression and therapeutic resistance. The ability of a gene signature from reprogrammed PCa cells to identify tumors from patients with metastasis or PCa-specific mortality implies that developmental reprogramming is linked to aggressive tumor behaviors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently copy number variation (CNV) has gained considerable interest as a type of genomic/genetic variation that plays an important role in disease susceptibility. Advances in sequencing technology have created an opportunity for detecting CNVs more accurately. Recently whole exome sequencing (WES) has become primary strategy for sequencing patient samples and study their genomics aberrations. However, compared to whole genome sequencing, WES introduces more biases and noise that make CNV detection very challenging. Additionally, tumors' complexity makes the detection of cancer specific CNVs even more difficult. Although many CNV detection tools have been developed since introducing NGS data, there are few tools for somatic CNV detection for WES data in cancer. RESULTS In this study, we evaluated the performance of the most recent and commonly used CNV detection tools for WES data in cancer to address their limitations and provide guidelines for developing new ones. We focused on the tools that have been designed or have the ability to detect cancer somatic aberrations. We compared the performance of the tools in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) using real data and simulated data. Comparative analysis of the results of the tools showed that there is a low consensus among the tools in calling CNVs. Using real data, tools show moderate sensitivity ({\~{}}50{\%} - {\~{}}80{\%}), fair specificity ({\~{}}70{\%} - {\~{}}94{\%}) and poor FDRs ({\~{}}27{\%} - {\~{}}60{\%}). Also, using simulated data we observed that increasing the coverage more than 10× in exonic regions does not improve the detection power of the tools significantly. CONCLUSIONS The limited performance of the current CNV detection tools for WES data in cancer indicates the need for developing more efficient and precise CNV detection methods. Due to the complexity of tumors and high level of noise and biases in WES data, employing advanced novel segmentation, normalization and de-noising techniques that are designed specifically for cancer data is necessary. Also, CNV detection development suffers from the lack of a gold standard for performance evaluation. Finally, developing tools with user-friendly user interfaces and visualization features can enhance CNV studies for a broader range of users.},
annote = {This paper explored a comparative analysis between current CNV analysis tools that operate in the context of whole exome sequencing which in wide use in the field. The group narrowed the landscape down to just 5 tools that meet a few criteria.

* There are 3 approaches to identifying CNVs
+ read count (read depth)
+ paired-end
+ assembly
* All tools the group evaluated used the read depth method since the pair-end and assembly methods are rendered ineffective with low read coverage like is seen in exome data. All CNV detection tools for WES are based on this method as a result.
* Ambiguities in alignment can create bias in the RD approach.
* The hybridization process and an uneven distribution of reads in exonic regions leads to bias.
* There are reads in the WES data that will be overlapping noise which would otherwise be delineated in the scRNA data. I will have to account for this.
* As of 2016, there are 15 seq-based CNV tools.
* B allele frequencies (BAF) is used to address tumor complexity in some of these tools.
* Group used both read and synthesized data.
* Look at table 1 for feature breakdown
* Look at table 4 for performance summary

ADTEx

* Newest of the tools they evaluated
* Has ability to leverage BAF
* Uses Discrete Wavelet Transform as a preprocessing step to reduce noise.
* Two Hidden Markov Models are used in detection.
* CBS is used in segmentation

Contra

* used for very small target regions.
* normalizes read count and log ratios for each base.
* better for reducing effect of GC bias.
* addresses problem of very low coverage and GC bias.

cn.MOPS

* Can use multiple samples for each genomics region to create a better estimate
* Uses a non-overlapping sliding window.
* Creates a null-hypothesis to measure distance to observed value.
* Can reduce false discovery rate

ExomeCNV

* Specifically design for WES data.
* Can use BAF data
* Counts overlapping reads from exons by using these counts for tumor and normal.
* Can also detect loss of heterzygosity.

VarScan2

* Also specfiically designed for WES data from tumor-normal.
* Does not use a sliding window.
* Calculates tumor to normal read count ratios of high quality base that fullfill minmum coverage requirements.
* Using Fischers test, consecutive bases do not change significantly are binned together.
* Does not utilize a segmentation algorithm, CBS is advised.

Results

* The tools show low consistency.
* only about 25{\%} of the true amplified genes and deleted genes were identified by all tools in the gene-based comparison.
* In the segment-based comparison, the sensitivities and FDRs were all comparably similar to the gene-based comparison.
* There was no consistency among tools for the size and number of detected CNVs as well.
* Due to contra's approach, it excels with clean data but may not be suitable for messay cancer data.
* Mis-detection of poor coverage sequences is a central cause of the poor performance.
* Because of the poor performance across the tools, there is a great need for improvement in preprocessing techniques.
* A point made that may hold relevance to my project is that tumor subclonality has not been addressed by any tool. The granularity offered by our scRNA data could help with this.},

abstract = {Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy number profiles at the cellular level. This technology circumvents the averaging effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and increases resolution while decreasing ambiguity in tracking the evolutionary history of cancer. ScDNA-seq data is, however highly sparse and noisy due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data. The main features of SCOPE include: (i) a Poisson latent factor model for normalization, which borrows information across cells and regions to estimate bias, using negative control cells identified by cell-specific Gini coefficients; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the normalization step, which accounts for the aberrant copy number changes that deviate from the null distributions; and (iii) a cross-sample segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from the same subclone. We evaluate SCOPE on a diverse set of scDNA-seq data in cancer genomics, using array-based calls of purified bulk samples as gold standards and whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing as orthogonal validations; we find that, compared to existing methods, SCOPE offers more accurate copy number estimates. Further, we demonstrate SCOPE on three recently released scDNA-seq datasets by 10X Genomics: we show that it can reliably recover 1{\%} cancer cell spike-ins from a background of normal cells and that it successfully reconstructs cancer subclonal structure from ∼10,000 breast cancer cells.},

However, the mechanisms by which alterations of these glioblastoma genes singly and cooperatively transform brain cells remain poorly understood. Further, the cell of origin of glioblastoma is largely elusive. By targeting a p53 in-frame deletion mutation to the brain, we show that p53 deficiency provides no significant growth advantage to adult brain cells, but appears to induce pleiotropic accumulation of cooperative oncogenic alterations driving gliomagenesis. Our data show that accumulation of a detectable level of mutant p53 proteins occurs first in neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and that subsequent expansion of mutant p53-expressing Olig2+ transit-amplifying progenitor-like cells in the SVZ-associated areas initiates glioma formation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {All cancer registries constantly show striking differences in cancer incidence by age and among tissues. For example, lung cancer is diagnosed hundreds of times more often at age 70 than at age 20, and lung cancer in nonsmokers occurs thousands of times more frequently than heart cancer in smokers. An analysis of these differences using basic concepts in cell biology indicates that cancer is the end-result of the accumulation of cell divisions in stem cells. In other words, the main determinant of carcinogenesis is the number of cell divisions that the DNA of a stem cell has accumulated in any type of cell from the zygote. Cell division, process by which a cell copies and separates its cellular components to finally split into two cells, is necessary to produce the large number of cells required for living. However, cell division can lead to a variety of cancer-promoting errors, such as mutations and epigenetic mistakes occurring during DNA replication, chromosome aberrations arising during mitosis, errors in the distribution of cell-fate determinants between the daughter cells, and failures to restore physical interactions with other tissue components. Some of these errors are spontaneous, others are promoted by endogenous DNA damage occurring during quiescence, and others are influenced by pathological and environmental factors. The cell divisions required for carcinogenesis are primarily caused by multiple local and systemic physiological signals rather than by errors in the DNA of the cells. As carcinogenesis progresses, the accumulation of DNA errors promotes cell division and eventually triggers cell division under permissive extracellular environments. The accumulation of cell divisions in stem cells drives not only the accumulation of the DNA alterations required for carcinogenesis, but also the formation and growth of the abnormal cell populations that characterize the disease. This model of carcinogenesis provides a new framework for understanding the disease and has important implications for cancer prevention and therapy.},

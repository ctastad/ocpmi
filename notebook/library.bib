@article{Zheng2017a,
abstract = {Systematic interrogation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is key to the development of immunotherapies and the prediction of their clinical responses in cancers. Here, we perform deep single-cell RNA sequencing on 5,063 single T cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from six hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The transcriptional profiles of these individual cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, enable us to identify 11 T cell subsets based on their molecular and functional properties and delineate their developmental trajectory. Specific subsets such as exhausted CD8 + T cells and Tregs are preferentially enriched and potentially clonally expanded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we identified signature genes for each subset. One of the genes, layilin, is upregulated on activated CD8 + T cells and Tregs and represses the CD8 + T cell functions in vitro. This compendium of transcriptome data provides valuable insights and a rich resource for understanding the immune landscape in cancers.},

@article{Sahin2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. T cells directed against mutant neo-epitopes drive cancer immunity. However, spontaneous immune recognition of mutations is inefficient. We recently introduced the concept of individualized mutanome vaccines and implemented an RNA-based poly-neo-epitope approach to mobilize immunity against a spectrum of cancer mutations. Here we report the first-in-human application of this concept in melanoma. We set up a process comprising comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. All patients developed T cell responses against multiple vaccine neo-epitopes at up to high single-digit percentages. Vaccine-induced T cell infiltration and neo-epitope-specific killing of autologous tumour cells were shown in post-vaccination resected metastases from two patients. The cumulative rate of metastatic events was highly significantly reduced after the start of vaccination, resulting in a sustained progression-free survival. Two of the five patients with metastatic disease experienced vaccine-related objective responses. One of these patients had a late relapse owing to outgrowth of $\beta$2-microglobulin-deficient melanoma cells as an acquired resistance mechanism. A third patient developed a complete response to vaccination in combination with PD-1 blockade therapy. Our study demonstrates that individual mutations can be exploited, thereby opening a path to personalized immunotherapy for patients with cancer.},

annote = {* State of field for ovarian cancer * Current treatments and outcomes * Ovca presents very late. The internal location of the cancer and general lack of screening options lead to most cases being diagnosed at a later stage than many other cancers would. * Treatment options have largely focused on sugical debulking and platinum based chemotherapy. * Risk factors are inherited: germline mutations in breast cancer susceptible genes (e.g. brca), nulliparity, infertility, enometriosis, obesity, age, potentially perineal talc. * Reducing factors that have been found to be potentially significant are gravidity, oral contraceptive use, regular use of aspirin, and nsaids. * Currently, population screening in ovca has not been found to be effective. * Epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 95{\%} of ovarian malignancies * 5 eoc subtypes: high-grade serous, low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous * HGSOC has the highest incidence with 70{\%} of eoc cases. * It is believed fallopian tube epithelium is the possible site for tumor initiation. * Mutations in p53 are seen in +90{\%} cases of HGSOC * p53 mutations and brca inactivation lead to high numbers of copy variation. * HGSOC has 4 prognostic subtypes: differntiated, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and proliferative * Immunoreactive is considered to have the best overall survivial while mesenchymal has the worst. * Ovca cells also overexpress folate and mesothelin which have been targest for antibody therapy. * LGSOC is seen in about 10{\%} of cases * LGSOC is considered to develop in a pathway which is very distinct from HGSOC * B-Raf and KRAS mutations are the most commonly present in LGSOC * Hormone therapy is sometimes used due to the presence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. * CNAs in p53 are rare, and brca inactivation seem to unrelated to LGSOC * OCCC or clear cell carcinoma represents about 5{\%} of cases. * The pathogenesis of OCCC is not well understood. * A proposed mechanism is related to the level of iron content, promoting oxidative stress. * Mutations in the SWI/SNF and PI3K pathway are represented in large proportions of cases. * Activation of the PI3K or RTK pathway has resulted in better OS * OCCCs are found to have considerably fewer CNAs and mutations in p53 or brca genes. * Endometrioid cancers represent 10{\%} of EOC cases. * Current thought is that endometrioid and OCCC arise from similar pathways. * Deregulation of WNT/b-catenin and PI3K pathways are essential in mouse models. * Mucinous OC is a rare subtype. * Could be classified as non-invasive and infiltrative. * KRAS mutations are a common feature of this subtype. * p53 and brca mutations do not seem to play a role. * Treatment * To date, there has been no randomized assessment of debulking surgery, platinum therapy, or radiation therapy. * Surgery has been the bedrock of therapy. * Surgery involves many approaches including primary, interval, and secondary debulking * Chemotherapy * carboplatin is as effective as cisplatin and is better tolerated. * dose is important. * pairing drugs does not improve outcomes. * IP chemo is often used due to the tight localization of ovca in the abdomen * hyperthermic IP chemo is currently being explored with reasonable results * Treatment after recurrence follows several judgements of benefit. * Recurrence after a period of over 6mo suggests platnum sensitivity where platinum based chemo would be reapplied * Shorter intervals of recurrence employ non-platinum based therarpies * Current consensus is the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel together every 3wks * Targeted therarpy has beeng gradually introduced in recent years. * Bevacizumab has shown the greatest promise among antiangiogenics being the only one in clinical use. * PARP inhibitors * Used as maintenance with platinum therapy at the time of recurrence. * A trial showed that the key benefit in PFS was driven by the parp inhibitor maintenance therapy. * Trial from 2018 led to first-line maintenance in brca mutated cases * Stratified approach to systemtic therapy can be used with bevacizumab after surgery with a switch to maintenance on the basis of brca mutations. * Immunetherapy is currently being explored on several fronts though none are in clinical practice. * ovca has a high expression of PD-L1. * Checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1/PD1 or CTLA-4 have shown only modest results. * Autologous cell therapy is also being utilized. * A variation of this therpay is exploring car-t cells targeting mesothelin * Vaccines have not worked well due to the highly immunosuppressive cancer environment * A vaccine targeting survivin is currently being explored * Additionally, the concept of the patient-specific mutanome is being researched in an effort to develope patient-specific cancer vaccines. * OCCC and LGSOC are relatively chemoresistant. * Prevention and screening are currently limited. * There is no validated screening method for standard practice. * Ultrasound has produced false-negatives and false-positives and is not recommended. * Screening high-risk populations has been shown to be effective but requires prior knowledge of family history. * Some biomarkers have been utilized such as HE4 in combination with CA125. * Another approach has been to evaluate DNA methylation in cfDNA.},

@article{Papalexi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have allowed for comprehensive analysis of the immune system. In this Review, we briefly describe the available scRNA-seq technologies together with their corresponding strengths and weaknesses. We discuss in depth how scRNA-seq can be used to deconvolve immune system heterogeneity by identifying novel distinct immune cell subsets in health and disease, characterizing stochastic heterogeneity within a cell population and building developmental 'trajectories' for immune cells. Finally, we discuss future directions of the field and present integrated approaches to complement molecular information from a single cell with studies of the environment, epigenetic state and cell lineage.},

@article{Tirosh2016,
abstract = {Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.},

@article{Macintyre2018,
abstract = {The genomic complexity of profound copy number aberrations has prevented effective molecular stratification of ovarian cancers. Here, to decode this complexity, we derived copy number signatures from shallow whole-genome sequencing of 117 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases, which were validated on 527 independent cases. We show that HGSOC comprises a continuum of genomes shaped by multiple mutational processes that result in known patterns of genomic aberration. Copy number signature exposures at diagnosis predict both overall survival and the probability of platinum-resistant relapse. Measurement of signature exposures provides a rational framework to choose combination treatments that target multiple mutational processes.},

  note      = {* State of field for ovarian cancer * Current treatments and outcomes * Ovca presents very late. The internal location of the cancer and general lack of screening options lead to most cases being diagnosed at a later stage than many other cancers would. * Treatment options have largely focused on sugical debulking and platinum based chemotherapy. * Risk factors are inherited: germline mutations in breast cancer susceptible genes (e.g. brca), nulliparity, infertility, enometriosis, obesity, age, potentially perineal talc. * Reducing factors that have been found to be potentially significant are gravidity, oral contraceptive use, regular use of aspirin, and nsaids. * Currently, population screening in ovca has not been found to be effective. * Epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 95% of ovarian malignancies * 5 eoc subtypes: high-grade serous, low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous * HGSOC has the highest incidence with 70% of eoc cases. * It is believed fallopian tube epithelium is the possible site for tumor initiation. * Mutations in p53 are seen in +90% cases of HGSOC * p53 mutations and brca inactivation lead to high numbers of copy variation. * HGSOC has 4 prognostic subtypes: differntiated, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and proliferative * Immunoreactive is considered to have the best overall survivial while mesenchymal has the worst. * Ovca cells also overexpress folate and mesothelin which have been targest for antibody therapy. * LGSOC is seen in about 10% of cases * LGSOC is considered to develop in a pathway which is very distinct from HGSOC * B-Raf and KRAS mutations are the most commonly present in LGSOC * Hormone therapy is sometimes used due to the presence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. * CNAs in p53 are rare, and brca inactivation seem to unrelated to LGSOC * OCCC or clear cell carcinoma represents about 5% of cases. * The pathogenesis of OCCC is not well understood. * A proposed mechanism is related to the level of iron content, promoting oxidative stress. * Mutations in the SWI/SNF and PI3K pathway are represented in large proportions of cases. * Activation of the PI3K or RTK pathway has resulted in better OS * OCCCs are found to have considerably fewer CNAs and mutations in p53 or brca genes. * Endometrioid cancers represent 10% of EOC cases. * Current thought is that endometrioid and OCCC arise from similar pathways. * Deregulation of WNT/b-catenin and PI3K pathways are essential in mouse models. * Mucinous OC is a rare subtype. * Could be classified as non-invasive and infiltrative. * KRAS mutations are a common feature of this subtype. * p53 and brca mutations do not seem to play a role. * Treatment * To date, there has been no randomized assessment of debulking surgery, platinum therapy, or radiation therapy. * Surgery has been the bedrock of therapy. * Surgery involves many approaches including primary, interval, and secondary debulking * Chemotherapy * carboplatin is as effective as cisplatin and is better tolerated. * dose is important. * pairing drugs does not improve outcomes. * IP chemo is often used due to the tight localization of ovca in the abdomen * hyperthermic IP chemo is currently being explored with reasonable results * Treatment after recurrence follows several judgements of benefit. * Recurrence after a period of over 6mo suggests platnum sensitivity where platinum based chemo would be reapplied * Shorter intervals of recurrence employ non-platinum based therarpies * Current consensus is the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel together every 3wks * Targeted therarpy has beeng gradually introduced in recent years. * Bevacizumab has shown the greatest promise among antiangiogenics being the only one in clinical use. * PARP inhibitors * Used as maintenance with platinum therapy at the time of recurrence. * A trial showed that the key benefit in PFS was driven by the parp inhibitor maintenance therapy. * Trial from 2018 led to first-line maintenance in brca mutated cases * Stratified approach to systemtic therapy can be used with bevacizumab after surgery with a switch to maintenance on the basis of brca mutations. * Immunetherapy is currently being explored on several fronts though none are in clinical practice. * ovca has a high expression of PD-L1. * Checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1/PD1 or CTLA-4 have shown only modest results. * Autologous cell therapy is also being utilized. * A variation of this therpay is exploring car-t cells targeting mesothelin * Vaccines have not worked well due to the highly immunosuppressive cancer environment * A vaccine targeting survivin is currently being explored * Additionally, the concept of the patient-specific mutanome is being researched in an effort to develope patient-specific cancer vaccines. * OCCC and LGSOC are relatively chemoresistant. * Prevention and screening are currently limited. * There is no validated screening method for standard practice. * Ultrasound has produced false-negatives and false-positives and is not recommended. * Screening high-risk populations has been shown to be effective but requires prior knowledge of family history. * Some biomarkers have been utilized such as HE4 in combination with CA125. * Another approach has been to evaluate DNA methylation in cfDNA.},
